## Overview of Project: An analysis of kickstarter play projects outcomes based on launch dates and goals
The purpose of this project is to analyze the outcomes of kickstarter play projects based on their launch dates and goals to find any trends on these two variables.

## Analysis and Challenges:
I perfomed the first analysis using a pivot chart and used a line graph to display the results for Theater outcomes based on launch dates. For the second analysis, I created a new sheet to look at outcomes based on goals data and used a line graph to display the results. One challenge would be that the data provided is very broad, covering a lot of different kickstarter projects of several categories in different countries. Due to this range, this may have produced a lot of irrelevant data or used a lot of resources for the projects, which could be narrowed down which may be more relevant and successful to Louise's goals e.g. kickstarting play projects in the U.S.

## Results
### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? 
* One conclusion is that the successful rate of theatre kickstarter projects were around the months of May until August (with the most successful month being May). This may suggest that more successful projects were launched around the Spring/ Summer season. 
* Another conclusion that relates to this trend is that the failed projects spiked in October where successful projects also began to dive down.

### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The most successful projects had goals that were less than $1000. The graph also supports this trend by showing that the rate of failed projects were higher when the goal was set higher than $1000.

### What are some limitations of this dataset? 
For the Outcomes based on goals analysis, the graph doesn't show the total overall number of play projects. This may not be a true reflection of the percentages of successful or failed projects. For example it shows 100% failed for projects with a goal ranging from $45000 to $49999, however this was just one project and so this theory may not be useful to help Louise decide in the future whether or not to set a goal around this amount as there is only one project to reflect this strategy.

### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? 
I think it would be better to review this strategy by looking at the total number of play projects against the outcomes and their goals which will show better data that will not be skewed due to the above challenge that I mentioned. I would use a cluster bar chart to display the results to look at the the percentages of successful and failed projects against the their overall total projects (not total projects by their goal ranges). This will help review the strategy of whether or not the range of goals is related to the successes or fails of the kickstarter project.
